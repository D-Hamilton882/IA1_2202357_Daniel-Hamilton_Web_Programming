	<h1><center>MISSION</center>

<h1><center>Personal Development</center></h1>
<h1>Chapter 4 – Achieve Your Goals</h1>


<p>This chapter emphasizes the power of goal setting. The authors explain that success does not happen by accident; it begins with clearly defining what you want. They stress writing down goals, breaking them into long-term and short-term objectives, and reviewing them regularly. Goals give direction, motivation, and a sense of purpose.</p>

<p>As a 21-year-old university student in my final year, this chapter speaks directly to me. Graduation is close, and it is easy to feel uncertain about the future. Setting clear goals—such as completing my degree with strong grades, securing employment, and becoming financially stable—gives me focus. Instead of simply “hoping” things work out, I must plan intentionally. Writing down my career goals and taking small daily actions, like improving my CV or applying for internships, aligns my current efforts with my future ambitions.</p>

<h1>Chapter 5 – The Proper Use of Time</h1>

<p>This chapter teaches that time is more valuable than money because it cannot be replaced. Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day, but what separates successful people is how they use those hours. The authors highlight the importance of prioritizing meaningful activities instead of wasting time on distractions.</p>

<p>As a final-year student, time management is critical. Balancing classes, assignments, possible part-time work, and personal life can be overwhelming. This chapter reminds me that scrolling on social media or procrastinating has long-term consequences. If I discipline myself to use my time wisely studying consistently, preparing for exams early, and working on projects ahead of deadlines. I reduce stress and improve performance. Learning to manage time now prepares me for the professional world, where productivity and discipline are highly valued.</p>

<h1>Chapter 6 – Surround Yourself with the Best People</h1>

<p>This chapter focuses on the influence of relationships. The authors explain that we become like the people we spend the most time with. Positive, ambitious, and disciplined individuals inspire growth, while negative influences can limit potential. Choosing friends and mentors wisely is essential for personal development.</p>

<p>As a university student, this is very relevant. The people around me can either motivate me to work harder or distract me from my goals. Being around classmates who are serious about their studies pushes me to stay focused. Networking with lecturers, professionals, or career-driven peers can also open doors to opportunities. If I want to become financially stable and successful, I must intentionally build relationships with people who reflect the future I desire.</p>

<h1>Chapter 7 – Be a Lifelong Learner</h1>

<p>This chapter teaches that formal education may end, but learning should never stop. The authors encourage continuous self-improvement through reading, listening to educational content, and developing new skills. Lifelong learning leads to personal growth and increased opportunities.</p>

<p>As a final-year student, it is tempting to think that once I graduate, I am finished with studying. However, this chapter challenges that mindset. The job market is competitive, and industries constantly evolve. To remain valuable, I must continue learning—whether through professional certifications, online courses, or reading books that improve my mindset and financial knowledge. Adopting the habit of lifelong learning will help me adapt, grow professionally, and move closer to my goal of financial stability.</p>
